For now, we just have a Singularity file (rather than one or more Singularity.tag files)

The code expects a file `value_to_double.txt` in the current directory, 
containing an integer.

It prints on STDOUT the double of that value, and stores the triple (3*x) 
of that value on a file triple_value.tmp in the same current folder.
